# JS Testing Boilerplates

This repository aims to make it easy to add tests to an existing client-side JavaScript project. It presently provides a boilerplate for the following frameworks:

- [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/)

I'm actively soliciting boilerplates for the following frameworks:

- [QUnit](http://qunitjs.com/)
- [Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/)
- [CasperJS](http://casperjs.org/)

I also welcome boilerplates for any frameworks I haven't listed!

## Using the boilerplates

See the README files inside the individual boilerplates for details.
