# Mocha Boilerplate

This is a boilerplate for adding Mocha tests to your client-side JavaScript project. To use it, clone the parent repository, and then:

- Copy the `mocha-boilerplate` directory to your project, placing it wherever you'd like.

## Configuring the tests

## Creating a test

## Using the boilerplate with Grunt

- Install [Node]()
- Run `npm install` from this directory
- Install [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/download.html) if you'd like to be able to run the tests "headless" -- that is, without having to open them in a browser.
